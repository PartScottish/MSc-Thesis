Title: An investigation of supervised classification of therapeutic process from text.

Description: Refining basic and advanced machine learning algorithms including MLPC neural nets, fine-tuned with grid-searching, to apply therapeutic process labels to therapist-patient transcribed conversation turns. This project aimed to run controls without data augmentation but then, crucially, implement varying level of data augmentation (30, 60 and 90% increased data) in addition to combining techniques, to assess whether it improves the outcome of the estimations. This project found novel and profound results not limited to those which will shape the future of all research in this field.
